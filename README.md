## About Me
:book: I'm from Finance, Math and Engineering background. But I'm currently focusing on using my Engineering and Math side of knowledge to build robust, stable and high performance data pipelines and end-to-end Machine learning pipelines. My very high level mission is to build integrated AI-based tools or solutions that could eventually simplify the process of making decision, ie to make our life much more efficient.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm interested in the area of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and AutoML. Besides these, I love :tennis: tennis, meditation, digital painting and trading in my spare time.
